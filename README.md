## What is Dad Jokes GPT?

Dad Jokes GPT is a custom GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) designed to entertain users with dad jokes. Upon receiving a prompt for a joke, it uses an API (https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) to fetch a dad joke and then employs DALLÂ·E image generation capability to create a visual representation of the joke, enhancing the comedic experience.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains two key files:

- `prompt.txt`: This file contains the prompt used to define the behavior of the Dad Jokes GPT. It includes the instructions and goals for the GPT, guiding it to respond with just the joke's text followed by a visual

- `action.json`: This file holds the action JSON data, which defines the actual interaction and response mechanics of the GPT. It is crucial for integrating the API

## How to Use
